1. ABOUT SIMPLECOMMENTER ~
                                                       *simplecommenter-about*

SimpleCommenter is precisely what its name suggests - a simpler, smaller, and
more primitive alternative to the other commentary plugins available for Vim.
SimpleCommenter aims to be

    ▶ Non-intrusive - only there when you need it.
    ▶ Respectful of your workflow - xkcd.com/1172/
    ▶ Simply functional - 'it just works'

2. KEY MAPPINGS ~
                                                 *simplecommenter-keymappings*

SimpleCommenter doesn't have a default keymapping for commenting or
uncommenting lines, so that it doesn't conflict with any keymappings that you
might already have configured.
However, this is not a big disadvantage, because setting a keymapping for the
plugin's functionality is very simple.
<
  " mapping for SimpleCommenter - comment out line
  nmap <KEY> :SimpleComment<cr>
  " insert mode mapping
  imap <KEY> <esc>:SimpleComment<cr>i

  " mapping for SimpleCommenter - uncomment line
  nmap <KEY> :SimpleUncomment<cr>
  " insert mode mapping
  imap <KEY> <esc>:SimpleUncomment<cr>i
